  /**     \brief initializes the sparse anisotropic index set
  *       \param[in] q is the maximum level for the sparse index set
  *       \param[in] dim is the dimension of the sparse index set
  *       \param[in] cpFun is the comparison Function. sparse index set is

  *                  the sparse index set
  *
  * 	    Additionally, the set of multiindices _alpha and the weights _cw
  *     	 are provided globally.
  *
  * 	    The function comp_indexSet computes a sparse multi index set
  * 	    _alpha\subset\N^n by the function call
  *       sparseIndexSet::Yw_alpha(0, &n, cpFun)
  * 	    and corresponding weights _cw \in \Z^n to each multi index.
  * 	    To determine the weights, we have to check for each multi index
  *       alpha contained in _alpha if alpha + beta is in _alpha for each beta 
  *       in {0,1}^{n}. If this is the case, we update the weight by 
  *       (-1)^|beta|. Of course, the condition is always fulfilled for the 
  *       multiindex beta = 0. Therefore, we skip this multiindex and initialize
  *       the weight cw with 1 which is associated with the second variable in
  *       the function call to cw_alpha.
  * 	    For a multi index alpha, the corresponding weight has only to be
  *       computed if the multiindex alpha+1 is not contained in _alpha.
  *       Otherwise, the corresponding weight is 0. With the index set, the
  *       weights and the unidirectional quadrature formulas at hand, the
  *       integral I(f) is approximated by the combination technique formula
  * 	    I(f) \approx \sum_{i =0}^{_alpha.cols-1} _cw(i)*Q_{alpha.col(i)}.
  * 	    Herein, _alpha.cols determines the number of multiindices in _alpha
  *       and alpha.col(i) gives the i-th index in _alpha. The tensor product
  *       quadrature formula Q_{alpha.col(i)} is specified by the unidirectional
  *       quadrature formulas.

  *	    Additionally, the level of the sparse grid _q, the dimension of the
  *	    multiindices _dim and the memory _alpha for the indexset is
  *	    provided globally and referred to.
  *
  *	    The function Yw_alpha recursively computes the indexset of a
  *	    generalized sparse grid which is described by a level _q and a
  *	    function cpFun, i.e. it finds all multiindices alpha such that
  *	    cpFun(alpha)<= _q. To that end, we travel the set Xw_alpha and
  *       at a multi index only if the corresponding _cw is non zero.
  *	    The function needs to be called with input parameters
  *	    maxBit=0, k=0 defined as a reference, predefined
  *	    function cpFun which maps from \mathbb{N}^{_dim}\to \mathbb{R}.
  *	    Since cpFun(0)=0, the zero multiindex is always the first index
  *	    which is included in the sparse grid on default and serves as the
  *	    root node in the tree structure of the index set.
  *	    On level l of the tree, all indices alpha with
  *	    cpFun(alpha)<= _q and |alpha| = l-1 are computed.
  *	    Moreover, the tree is structured such that all indices alpha' which
  *	    are sons of a multiindex alpha fulfill alpha'>=alpha elementwise.
  *	    This structure immediately allows to exploit the downward closeness
  *	    of the indexset since we do not need a further recursion level
  *	    at an edge where the corresponding index does not belong to the
  *       indexset.
  *	    Moreover, the integer maxBit is necessary to avoid multiple
  *       repetition of multiindices. In every step maxBit is the position of
  *       the digit which is modified to obtain the current multiindex. In the
  *       subtree corresponding to this index only digits greater or equal to
  *       maxBit will be considered for modification. A simple example for the
  *       tree structure for _q=2, _dim=2 and cpFun(alpha) = alpha_1+alpha_2 is
  *       depicted below.

  *
  *	    Additionally, the level of the sparse grid _q, the dimension of the
  *	    multiindices _dim and the memory _alpha for the indexset is
  *	    provided globally.
  *
  *	    The function cw_alpha computes the coefficient of the indth
  *	    multi index in the combination technique formula corresponding to
  *	    the generalized sparse quadrature. This coefficient is given by
  *	    cw(alpha) = sum_{beta in {0,1}^_dim, alpha+beta in _alpha}
  *       (-1)^|beta|. Hence, in order to determine the value of the
  *       coefficient, we have to check for each beta in {0,1}^_dim if
  *       alpha+beta belongs to the index set _alpha. For beta=(0,...,0),
  *       alpha+beta belongs to _alpha and, hence, we
  *       initialize cw=1 and do not have to consider this multiindex.
  *	    The downward closeness of the index set can be exploited once more
  *	    which results in a similar tree structure as in the function
  *       Yw_alpha. The only difference of the tree is that once a digit of the
  *       multiindex alpha is modified, we do not have to consider further
  *       modification of this digit due to the condition beta in {0,1}^_dim.
  *       This is realized in the recursive algorithm consider only digits which
  *       are greater than maxBit in contrast to the "greater than and equal"
  *       condition in Yw_alpha.
  *	    In the recursive algorithm, the multiindices beta do not need to be
  *       computed explicitly, but the multiindex alpha is modified at each node
  *       of the tree. Of course, this modification has to be revoked when the
  *       recursion goes back to the parent node in the tree.
  *	    The value of lvl=|beta| is important since it determines whether the
  *	    coefficient is modified by +1 or -1.
  *	    A simple example of the algorithm for _q=2, _dim=2, ind = (1,0) and
  *	    cpFun(alpha) = alpha_1+alpha_2 is depicted below.
  *	    The further initial values are maxBit=mB=0, cw = 1, lvl=0.
  *
  *								(1,0;mB=0;lvl=0;cw=1)
  *								/                   \
  *					(2,0;mB=0;lvl=1;cw=0)   (1,1;mB=1;lvl=1;cw=-1)
  *							/
  *			[ (2,1;mB=1;lvl=2;cw=0) ] <-- is not contained in the
  *                                   indexset, no modification of cw
  *
  *	    The algorithm returns the final value of cw. In the example above
  *       this would be the correct value cw(1,0)=-1.
